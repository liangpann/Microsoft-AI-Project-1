# Microsoft-AI-Project-1

1. Detailed Description of the Idea and Project

- 

2. Environment Setup & Dependencies

- My program takes 3 command line arguments. The first argument is the path to the training data file, the second is the path to the testing data file, and the third is the name of the algorithm to be executed (NB for Naive Bayes and kNN for the Nearest Neighbour, where k is replaced with a number; e.g. 5NN).

- The input training file will consist of several rows of data, each with n attributes plus a single class value (yes or no). The file will not have a header row, will have one example per line, and each line will consist of a normalised value for each of the non-class attributes separated by commas, followed by a class value.

- The input testing data file will consist of several new examples to test your data on. THe file will not have a header row, will have one example per line, and each line will consists of a normalised value for each of the non-class attributes separated by commas.

- My progam will output to standard output (a.k.a. "the console"). THe output will be one class value (yes or no) per line - each line representing my program's classification of the corresponding line in the input file.
